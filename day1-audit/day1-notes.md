## Day 1 â€“ Mastering File Discovery & Navigation Tools
Focus: tree, find, locate, ls -l, umask

### Tasks:
Install and run tree on /etc, then on /home

Use find to locate all .conf files under /etc

Update locate with sudo updatedb, then search for nginx.conf

Check your umask, then test how new files/directories are created with it

### Bonus:
Change your umask temporarily, test again, then reset it
